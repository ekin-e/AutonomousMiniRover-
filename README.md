# Autonomous Mini Rover

Our project involved designing and building an autonomous robot car capable of following
an object, typically a hand, placed in front of it. The robot integrates sensors and control
systems to dynamically scan its environment, detect objects, and respond by maintaining a
fixed distance from the detected object. This capability is a foundational element of many
autonomous systems and allowed our group to explore sensing and responding to a real-time
environment.

This robot represents a fundamental implementation of the concept of using sensor input
to maintain a desired state, a principle widely applied in various systems. For example,
HVAC systems use temperature data to adjust heating or cooling to maintain a set temperature.
Similarly, our robot uses distance measurements from two front-facing sensors to
decide its actions, whether to turn left, turn right, move forward, or reverse. All to maintain
a consistent distance from a detected object.
